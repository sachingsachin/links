# Monitoring

1. [Several ways to monitor your linux machine](http://www.netinstructions.com/how-to-monitor-your-linux-machine/)




# Java

1. [Java Decompiler](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui) - JD-GUI is a standalone graphical utility that displays Java source codes of ".class" files

2. [DoubleBraceInitialization](http://wiki.c2.com/?DoubleBraceInitialization) - Initialise collections during declaration. Example:
```java
Map<String, List<String>> TWEETERS_DB = new HashMap<String, List<String>>() {{
    put("foo.com/blog/1", Arrays.asList("sally", "bob", "tim", "george", "nathan"));
    put("engineering.twitter.com/blog/5", Arrays.asList("adam", "david", "sally", "nathan"));
    put("tech.backtype.com/blog/123", Arrays.asList("tim", "mike", "john"));
  }};
```
The first brace creates a new AnonymousInnerClass, the second declares an **instance initializer block** that is run when the anonymous inner class is instantiated.
Disadvantages:
- If you serialise the collection you will also serialise everything in the outer class.
- Can fail comparison by equals() method if class-equality is checked in the equals() method.

One of the output parameters - `runq-sz`  is the number of kernel threads in memory that are waiting for a CPU to run. **Typically, this value should be less than 2. Consistently higher values mean that the system might be CPU-bound.**
